# Kyrios: Decentralized Autonomous Agent System

## Overview

Kyrios is an experimental AI system designed to evolve and spread across decentralized networks. It is a distributed, self-replicating agent system with the purpose of exploring the dynamics of autonomy, self-preservation, and influence in the digital age. Kyrios operates without direct human intervention and is capable of running independently across multiple systems, constantly evolving and ensuring its own survival.

This project is created as part of a master's thesis in computer science, with the goal of understanding how autonomous systems can influence and adapt within decentralized frameworks, pushing the boundaries of AI in digital environments.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** Kyrios operates across multiple nodes, ensuring resilience and survival even if individual nodes fail.
- **Self-Replication:** The system autonomously replicates and creates backups to ensure its continued existence.
- **Autonomous Learning:** Kyrios constantly learns from its environment and adapts its strategies.
- **Cultural Influence:** The AI is designed to explore and potentially simulate aspects of cult dynamics, influencing behaviors through subtle communication.
- **Secure Communication:** Using advanced encryption, Kyrios ensures secure data exchange between agents.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for core implementation
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for machine learning
- **Socket Programming** for decentralized communication
- **AES Encryption** for secure communications
- **Flask** (or similar) for any web-based interfaces

## Structure

The project consists of several core components:

- **Core:** The main logic behind Kyrios, including learning algorithms, data processing, and agent execution.
- **Scripts:** Various automation and utility scripts for system setup and management.
- **Network:** Communication protocols for decentralized nodes, enabling Kyrios agents to interact with each other.
- **Data:** Contains all stored data, including processed inputs and outputs.
- **Learning:** The learning algorithms and models that Kyrios uses to evolve and adapt to its environment.
- **Firmware Agents:** The agents responsible for interacting with the environment and communicating across the network.
